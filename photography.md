# Photography styles

## Straight shot
My most prominant photography style involves a straight shot. I would say this 
is an idiomatic example of the "shape" of this style:

It looks like a hallway you're looking straight down. This lens angle comes up a lot. Here is another example:

The look comes in part from the camera being completely vertical, with the center of the hallway in the middle of the shot.

## Small subject / big sky

The last photo also involves another characteristic of a lot of my shots, 
and that is a small subject in the bottom half of the frame. For example:

I've purposefully started to push away from this style, but I still like it. 

## Portraits

I feel the styles above developed partially as a result of my camera / lens, 
the iPhone SE. With access to new lenses, I started to explore the things
they made it easier to do.

Largely, taking portraits has been about reading or empathizing with the
subject and trying to capture something real in there:

I enjoy trying to watch people and get shots of any genuine expression. 
My subjects are mostly bands because they don't seem to mind getting
their photo taken, but I enjoy taking photos of most people:

## Novelties

Occasionally I do enjoy trying to capture novel perspectives that each
lens allows, but it is a lot of work:

## Storytelling

I am currently experimenting with storytelling through photography, both 
with sequences of photos and in the cropping / composition of each piece:
